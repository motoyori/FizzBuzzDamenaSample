# Overview of 'FizzBuzzDamenaSample'
A deliberately bad solution to the FizzBuzz problem.

Created using Visual Studio 2022 (C#).

# License
No specific license. Feel free to use it as you wish.

However, please don't use this as a reference for solving the FizzBuzz problem
 (I wonder if there's anyone who's still trying to solve it now).

Especially for programming beginners who are under training or studying, please don't think,
 "So this is how to solve FizzBuzz!" and not submit this source code as your own!

(Experts can easily tell that you've copied it from somewhere.)

# Purpose (a noble lie)
I hope you can feel that there is no single correct answer in programming, and that you can create programs freely.

Issue Requests
If you can think of other "bad FizzBuzz source codes," please submit an issue.

## Conditions
- Must be C# source code (since this program is written in C#).
- Not too long. (If it's unnecessarily long, it will bore the reader.)
- Must correctly solve the FizzBuzz problem.
- The source code should be difficult for beginners to copy-paste and say, "I did it!"
- It would be even better if the bad source code could still be a little helpful for learning (but this is not mandatory).

## What is the FizzBuzz problem?

When displaying numbers from 1 to an arbitrary number (maximum MaxInt / temporarily up to 50),

- If the number is a multiple of 3, display "Fizz" instead of the number.
- If the number is a multiple of 5, display "Buzz" instead of the number.
- If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, display "FizzBuzz" instead of the number. Â  
Also, each value should be separated by a comma (,) and no newline should be added.

Output example:

1,2,Fizz,4,Buzz,Fizz,7,8,Fizz,FizzBuzz,11,Fizz,13,14,FizzBuzz,16...
